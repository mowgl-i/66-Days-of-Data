**Days of Data part 2** 
---

Week 1: Revisit previous work in python. Build python reflex.
---

Using [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).

---
- [x] Day 1: Finished [Tina's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww) [SQL for Tech and Data Science Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-for-tech-and-data-science-interviews/learn/lecture/26613654#questions/15758816)
- [x] Day 2: Spinned up a GCP Virtual Machine and loaded it with Python, Visual Studio and some additional helpers (Juypter, Black). First time coding in VS, liking it so far. Hopefully this VM set up will jumpstart some coding assignments untill I get some official credentials to work with client data. Test 
- [x] Day 3: Revisited Chapter 3 of Linked book above for pandas. Read and Looked at Pandas Profiling. May actually use in the next week. 
- [x] Day 4: Off topic - Looked at a few different ML certs. My productions skills are lacking, so I may need to change the content of this 66 days to better align with my weaknesses. Also re-built the VM to Linux and learned about Poetry(Dependency Manager)
- [x] Day 5: Yesterday and today were short on time. At work I learned how to use pyenv and poetry for version and dependency management. My goal is to remote into the GCP Virtual Machine (where pyenv is installed), and spin up two projects each with different versions of python, and different versions of the desired libraries. Pretty neat stuff!
- [x] Day 6: Briefly learned about Docker, Kubernetes and Kubeflow for machine learning. I have alot more to learn about containerized environments for ML deployment. 
- [x] Day 7: Learned about classes and Self. Now gotta learn to to make ML classes ðŸ˜­. Also forgot to push this, this it posted day 8 ðŸ˜… rip contributor streak.


Week 2: Looking for indepth pandas magic to speed up analysis. **I actually need to update the rest of the challenge since my objectives have changed a bit.**

- [x] Day 8: Read about the google style guide. Learned more about asserts and how to handle Try and Except blocks. I must get better at Docstrings as well for documenting classes. Also didn't know you can use Self outside of classes. 
- [x] Day 9: Brought code up to google docstring style. Used type hinting in a function. Learned briefly about to create python packages.  
- [x] Day 10: Writting an Python package complete with own modules. Nothing special just conducting RF model on the Iris dataset. Having it take key arguments, lots of self.thing. It feels much more modular this way. 
- [x] Day 11: Somewhat finished the package. It has it's own modules and .py files, runs main() when invoked and takes command line arguments with docopt. Also breezed through this: [Applied Pandas - Twitter Analytics](https://store.metasnake.com/courses/applied-pandas-twitter-analytics). I picked up this course from humble bundle. Going to read Noah Gift's ['Cloud Computing for Data Analysis'](https://leanpub.com/cloud4data). Hope to keep up with this for a few days on this challenge. 10 chapters, 1 chapter a day?? He also JUST published [Practical MLOps](https://github.com/noahgift)
- [x] Day 12: Read the first chapter of 'Cloud Computing for Data Analysis'. YO! That chapter was jammed packed with resources. I read through it, and tmr I will go through the linked resources. Then read Chapter 2 on day 13, then go over chapter 2 resources on Day 14? 
- [x] Day 13: Set up Azure resourse, Azure ML, Azure KeyVault, Azure Storage, Azure Insights... Just gotta get some data in there next. Hope to read chapter 2 tmr. 
- [x] Day 14: Light day today. Watched a brief video about [comparing different implementations of gradient bosting algos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6gJM_t1Bw). Of course aglos should be considered carefully when implementing but CatBoost came out on top for accuracy and speed(top speed meaning slowest algo).
